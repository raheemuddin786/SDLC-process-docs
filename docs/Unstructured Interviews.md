### Example Interview Transcript

#### Interview 1: Sarah, Senior Customer Service Rep (8 years experience)

**Interviewer**: "Hi Sarah, thanks for taking the time to meet with me today. I'm here to learn about your experience with customer support and understand what challenges you face. This conversation will help us design a customer portal that actually addresses real needs. There are no right or wrong answers - I'm just interested in hearing about your experiences. Sound good?"

**Sarah**: "Yes, that sounds fine. I'm happy to help."

**Interviewer**: "Great! Let's start with you telling me a bit about your role and what a typical day looks like for you."

**Sarah**: "Well, I've been doing customer service for about 8 years now. A typical day... hmm, it's really varied. I might handle 30-40 customer inquiries, sometimes more. Most of them come through phone calls, but we also get emails and some through our chat system. The thing is, a lot of the questions are really repetitive - like 'Where's my order?' or 'How do I reset my password?' - but each customer thinks their situation is unique, which I understand."

**Interviewer**: "You mentioned repetitive questions - can you tell me more about that? What does that feel like from your perspective?"

**Sarah**: "It's frustrating, honestly. Not because I don't want to help, but because I know if customers could just check their order status themselves, it would save everyone time. Like, probably 40% of my calls are just order status checks. The customer calls, I have to look up their order in our system, which sometimes takes a minute or two if the system is slow, then I tell them what they could have found themselves. And they're often frustrated because they had to wait on hold."

**Interviewer**: "That sounds like a significant portion of your time. What happens when you're dealing with these repetitive questions - how does it impact your ability to handle more complex issues?"

**Sarah**: "That's exactly the problem! When I'm stuck answering 'where's my order' questions, I can't help the customers who really need me - like someone whose order is actually lost, or who has a billing dispute, or needs help with a product issue. Those are the cases where my expertise actually matters. But by the time I get to them, I'm already tired from the repetitive stuff, and they've been waiting longer because I was busy with simple questions."

**Interviewer**: "That's a really important insight. Can you walk me through what happens when you get one of those more complex cases? Like, take me through a specific example if you can."

**Sarah**: "Sure. Last week, I had a customer whose order was delivered to the wrong address. So first, I had to access our order management system to see the order details. Then I needed to check our shipping partner's system to see the delivery confirmation. Then I had to look at the customer's account to see their address history. All of these are different systems, and I'm switching between tabs, copying information, trying to piece together what happened. It took me about 20 minutes just to understand the situation, and then another 15 to actually resolve it - contact the shipping company, update the address, arrange redelivery."

**Interviewer**: "So you're working across multiple systems to get the information you need. What's that experience like? What makes it difficult?"

**Sarah**: "It's really inefficient. I have to remember which system has what information. Sometimes the customer information doesn't match across systems - like their address might be slightly different in one system versus another. And I can't see the full picture of a customer's history in one place. Like, if they've had issues before, or if they're a VIP customer, or if there are special notes about their account - that information is scattered. I have to hunt for it."

**Interviewer**: "That sounds like a real challenge. If you could design the perfect system for yourself, what would it look like? What would make your job easier?"

**Sarah**: "Oh, that's easy! I'd want one screen that shows me everything about a customer - their order history, their account details, their previous support tickets, any special notes, their preferences. All in one place. And for the customers, I'd want them to be able to check their own order status, update their address, see their account info - all the simple stuff. That way, when they call me, it's because they actually need help, not because they couldn't find basic information."

**Interviewer**: "That's a great vision. Let me dig into that a bit - you mentioned customers calling because they can't find basic information. What do you think prevents them from finding it themselves right now?"

**Sarah**: "Well, we don't really have a customer portal. There's a website where they can shop, but if they want to check their order, they have to call us. Or if they want to see their order history, they have to call. There's no self-service option. And I think customers would use it if it was easy. I mean, people are used to checking their Amazon orders or their bank accounts online. They expect that now."

**Interviewer**: "So there's an expectation gap there. What do you think would make customers actually use a portal instead of calling?"

**Sarah**: "It has to be really easy. Like, if it takes more than two clicks to find their order, they'll just call. And it has to be fast - if the page takes forever to load, they'll hang up and call. And it needs to be mobile-friendly because a lot of customers are on their phones. Oh, and it needs to be secure - customers are worried about their information, especially payment stuff."

**Interviewer**: "Those are all really practical considerations. Let me shift gears a bit - you mentioned earlier that you're dealing with different types of inquiries. Can you tell me about the range of complexity? Like, what's the simplest thing you handle versus the most complex?"

**Sarah**: "The simplest? Password resets. That's literally just sending them a reset link. But we don't have an automated system for that, so they have to call, I verify their identity, then I manually trigger the reset. It's ridiculous. The most complex? Probably billing disputes where there's been fraud or a chargeback. Those can take hours to resolve because I need to coordinate with our finance team, the payment processor, sometimes the bank. And I need access to transaction logs, communication history, all sorts of information."

**Interviewer**: "That's quite a range. For those complex cases, what information or tools would help you resolve them faster?"

**Sarah**: "If I could see the full transaction history in one place, that would help. And if I could see all the communications - emails, previous calls, chat transcripts - in chronological order, that would be huge. Right now, I'm piecing together information from different places. And if there was a way to collaborate with other departments without having to send emails back and forth, that would save so much time."

**Interviewer**: "That's really helpful. One more thing - you've been doing this for 8 years. How has customer support changed in that time? What trends are you seeing?"

**Sarah**: "Customers are definitely more impatient now. They want instant answers. And they're more tech-savvy - they expect to be able to do things online. But at the same time, when something goes wrong, they want human help immediately. So I think the key is giving them self-service for the easy stuff, but making it really easy to get to a person when they need one. And the person they talk to needs to have all the information right there, not be hunting through systems."

**Interviewer**: "That's a really insightful perspective. Is there anything else you think I should know about your experience or what would make a portal successful?"

**Sarah**: "I think the most important thing is that it actually solves real problems. Not just checking boxes on a feature list, but actually making life easier for customers and for us. If it's hard to use or doesn't have the information people need, they'll just call anyway, and then we're back to square one. But if it's done right, it could really transform how we work."

**Interviewer**: "That's a perfect note to end on. Thank you so much, Sarah - your insights are incredibly valuable. I may have some follow-up questions as we analyze this, would that be okay?"

**Sarah**: "Absolutely, feel free to reach out."
