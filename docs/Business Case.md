## Financial Analysis Methods

### Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)

**Formula**: Net Benefit = Total Benefits - Total Costs

**Example**:
- Total Benefits: $1,000,000
- Total Costs: $600,000
- Net Benefit: $400,000

### Return on Investment (ROI)

**Formula**: ROI = (Benefits - Costs) / Costs × 100%

**Example**:
- Benefits: $1,000,000
- Costs: $600,000
- ROI = ($1,000,000 - $600,000) / $600,000 × 100%
- ROI = 66.7%

### Payback Period

**Formula**: Payback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Cash Flow

**Example**:
- Initial Investment: $600,000
- Annual Cash Flow: $200,000
- Payback Period = 3 years

### Net Present Value (NPV)

**Formula**: NPV = Σ (Cash Flow / (1 + r)^t) - Initial Investment

Where:
- r = discount rate
- t = time period

**Decision Rule**: Accept if NPV > 0
